In C#, a definition refers to the formal declaration of a type, method, variable, or other program element, where its name, type, and sometimes implementation are specified. Definitions are foundational in C# programming.

Here are examples of some common definitions in C#:

1. Class Definition
public class Car
{
    public string Make;
    public string Model;

    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The car is driving.");
    }
}


Car is a class definition.

It defines two fields (Make, Model) and a method (Drive).

2. Method Definition
public int Add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}


This defines a method named Add that takes two integers and returns their sum.

3. Variable Definition
int count = 10;
string name = "Alice";


int count and string name are variable definitions, each specifying a type and an identifier (with optional initialization).

4. Interface Definition
public interface IDriveable
{
    void Drive();
}


This defines an interface with a method signature but no implementation.

Summary:

A definition in C# provides enough information for the compiler to allocate memory, enforce type rules, and generate appropriate code. It is different from a declaration, which may just state the existence of a type or member without full details.
